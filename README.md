# TicTacToe
tic tac toe coded as a fun weekend project in java
This is definitely an over-complicated solution to coding this simple game, but I wanted to apply many of the oop concepts I have learnt, and made use of some cool data structures like HashMaps just to get practice of applying them in real code. The code if definitely overkill, but I'd appreciate feedback nonetheless.


TLDR; This code isn't that efficient, or the most simple solution, but it was fun regardless.
